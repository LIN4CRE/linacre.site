          These terms cover use of{' '}
          <a href="/" className="text-amber-color hover:underline">linacre.site</a>{' '}
          (&ldquo;the site&rdquo;) and any engagement between you (&ldquo;client&rdquo;) and{' '}
          <strong>David Linacre</strong>, sole trader operating as Linacre (&ldquo;we&rdquo;,
          &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;David&rdquo;). Individual client engagements are governed
          by a written Statement of Work that supersedes anything on this page if the two
          conflict.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">1. Using the site</h2>
        <p>
          The site, the free toolkit, the AI Lab, and other public content are provided
          &quot;as is&quot;. You may use them for lawful personal and commercial purposes.
          You may not attempt to break, scrape at scale, or reverse-engineer paid or
          private features (the API, the private dashboard, or the Identity Hub&#39;s
          server routes).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">2. Engagements &amp; deliverables</h2>
        <p>
          Every paid engagement is scoped in a written Statement of Work covering scope,
          milestones, price, timeline, and acceptance criteria. Invoices are issued in
          GBP, payable within 14 days of receipt unless the SoW says otherwise.
          Ownership of deliverables transfers to the client on full payment of the
          associated invoice; David retains the right to reuse generic components,
          patterns, and know-how developed in the process.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">3. Confidentiality &amp; NDAs</h2>
        <p>
          NDA-friendly by default. We keep client business information, source code,
          credentials, and pre-release plans confidential during the engagement and for
          two years afterwards. Client credentials are stored in a password manager, not
          in email or chat.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">4. Warranty &amp; liability</h2>
        <p>
          Deliverables come with a 30-day post-launch fix window for defects against the
          agreed acceptance criteria. Beyond that, our aggregate liability under any
          engagement is capped at the fees paid in the six months prior to the incident
          giving rise to the claim. We do not exclude liability for death, personal
          injury, fraud, or anything else that cannot be excluded by law.

      </section>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">5. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          Some deliverables integrate with third-party APIs (for example Vercel, Google
          Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, Cloudflare). Those services have their own
          terms, rate limits, and pricing. We&#39;re not liable for outages, price
          changes, or policy changes on those services.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">6. Data &amp; privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We handle personal data according to the{' '}
          <a href="/privacy" className="text-amber-color hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>{' '}
          and{' '}
          <a href="/cookie-policy" className="text-amber-color hover:underline">Cookie Policy</a>. A Data Processing Agreement is available on request for client engagements that involve processing personal data on your behalf.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-foreground">7. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms and any engagement are governed by the laws of England &amp; Wales.
          Disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England &amp;
          Wales.
